# Introduction 
A digitalisation of the Reclaim board game by created by the SPANS (Sanitation Planning for Alternative Nutrient-recovery Systems) project at the SLU (Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet). A System for Foundry <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/">Virtual Table Top</a>. Currently under developement with no public releases yet. 

The System has little automation and relies on the user to know the game's rules and how Foundry works. You can find Reclaim's manual included in this System's Journal Compendium. We also recommend that you install and use the pre-setup World which you can find at https://github.com/jennifermcconville/reclaim-world-foundryvtt
